# Dog-Breed-Prediction-Using-CNN

A machine learning-based web application to classify dog breeds using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The app is built with Flask for the backend and leverages a pre-trained deep learning model to predict dog breeds from user-uploaded images.

📝 Project Overview
This project allows users to upload a dog image and receive a prediction about the breed of the dog using a trained CNN model. The backend is powered by Flask, and the model is a deep learning architecture that was trained on a large dog breed dataset.
